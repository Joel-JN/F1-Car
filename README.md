# F1-Car
A Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of a Formula 1 car made using SolidEdge. The inspiration from the model was drawn from the Mercedes-AMG F1 W14 E Performance, commonly referred to as the Mercedes W14, driven by George Russell for the Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 team during the 2023 Formula 1 season.
SolidEdge was chosen as the preferred software tool because of its easy availability, simple user interface and the effortlessness in using its functions. The entire model was designed from scratch as a group of 6 members whose equal contribution to the project is recognised.
The model was sliced using Creality Slicer and fabricated out of Polylactic Acid (PLA), by 3D printing using an Ender-3 Neo 3D printer.
